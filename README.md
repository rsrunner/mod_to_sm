# `mod_to_sm`
Scan a mod release and create a [StepMania](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania) songpack out of it. Great for [Etterna](https://github.com/etternagame/etterna)!
Will not scan base game songs. Please remove base game content from mods.
Will also create `dance-single` charts because I hate playing charts Parappa-style.
